# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnoses based on patient data, aiming to help healthcare professionals identify malignancies early. Using machine learning algorithms, this model analyzes features from breast cancer cell images, such as cell radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness, to classify cases as malignant or benign.
